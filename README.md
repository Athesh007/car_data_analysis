This repository contains a data analysis project on car sales data with a user-friendly interface created using Streamlit. The data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/goyalshalini93/car-data).

The project is done using Python and its popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Streamlit.

2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.

## Usage

Run the following command in your terminal to start the Streamlit app:

## Results

The analysis explores the car sales data to answer the following questions:

1. What are the top 10 car brands sold in the US?
2. Which brand has the maximum average price of cars?
3. Which body type of cars sold the most?
4. Which state has the most number of car sales?
5. What is the correlation between the car price and car mileage?
6. How does the price distribution vary with respect to body type?

The analysis is presented with descriptive statistics, visualizations, and insights in a user-friendly interface created using Streamlit.
